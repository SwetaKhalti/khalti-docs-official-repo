There are four steps for integrating Khalti payment to a merchant system.



- [1. Signup as merchant](#1-signup-as-merchant)
- [2. Understand how khalti payment works](#2-understand-khalti-payment-process)
- [3. Test integration](#3-test-integration)
	- [3.1. Client side integration](##3.1-client-side-integration)
	- [3.2. Server side integration](##3.2-server-side-integration)
- [4. Deploy integration](#4-deploy-integration)

## 1. Signup as merchant
First of all you will need a merchant and a consumer accounts.
**Merchant** is an online business service like e-commerce websites, ISP online payment, Movie online purchase etc.
**Consumer** is an end user who uses Khalti to purchase products or services from merchants.

Please follow links below to create a merchant and a consumer accounts if you have not already.

- [Create a consumer account](https://khalti.com/join/)

## 2. Understand Khalti payment process

### 2.1. Transaction States
#### 1. Initiated

It is the first state of a transaction. Transactions are initiated after mobile number and khalti pin along with other transaction details are provided.

#### 2. Confirmed

A transaction is confirmed after transaction details (transaction token, confirmation_code and  3rd party transaction_pin) are provided by the consumer.

#### 3. Completed

Merchant server then requests khalti server to verify the transaction. After the transaction is in completed state consumer is informed the transaction was successfully completed.

#### 4. Disabled

A transaction could be disabled due to the possibility of 'confirmation_code' exploitation.

#### 5. Refunded

A merchant can refund the successful payments within a limited period of time.

#### 6. Partially refunded

A completed transaction also can be partially refunded.

#### 7. Failed

Normally, a successful transaction has at least three changes of states initiate, confirm and complete. A client first initiates and then confirms payment while the server finally verifies it and the payment process is completed.

## 3. Test integration
Now that you know how Khalti payment works. Its time to integrate it into your system.
A merchant must complete test integration using **test keys**. Test keys start with `test_`.

In test mode, transactions are sandboxed, which means fund is not moved from a consumer to the merchant.
Khalti must to be integrated at client and server.


**Payment via E-Banking and Debit/Credit card is not supported in the test environment.** After you successfully integrate wallet, you need not to concern about E-Banking and Card payment integration.

### 3.1. Client side integration
For now there is only one way to integrate Khalti at client side, through SDKs.
We have developed SDKs for every major plaforms and we call it `Checkout`.

Checkouts provide all the necessary UIs and perform necessary processes to initiate and confirm payment.

- [Web kit](./checkout/web.md)
- [Android kit](./checkout/android.md)
- [iOS kit](./checkout/ios.md)
- [Flutter kit](./checkout/flutter/khalti-flutter.md)

### 3.2. Server side integration
After user confirms payment, it has to be verified by Khalti.
**Fund from user account is moved to merchant only if verification succeeds.**
Verification must be done by the merchant server using a secret key.

- [Verification API](./api/verification.md)
- [Transaction API](./api/transaction.md)


## 4. Go live
After successful integration test, live keys will be generated in the merchant dashboard. The merchant must **replace test keys with live ones**.
Live keys start with `live_X`. Replace `test_public_X` and `test_secret_X` keys with `live_public_X` and `live_secret_X` keys respectively.

### 4.1. Further processes
Even successful integration itself doesn't let you receive payments above NRs. 200 per transaction. Please fill KYC form and contact us at 9801165565/9801856440/9801165558 to remove the limits and accept payments without restrictions.
